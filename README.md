# Forecasting-ozone-Layer-thickness

## Introduction

The sun emits UV radiation and ozone layer protects the earth from it. The thickness of the ozone layer is
calculated in the Dobson Unit. The data contains the thickness of the ozone layer from the year 1927 to 2016,
where the negative value implies the decrease in the ozone thickness layer and vice versa for the positive
value. In the first task, A hypothesis model is built over this data in order to predict the change in the ozone
layer thickness over the next five years. In the second task, the data will be used to build all set of
ARIMA(p,d,q) Models with plausible evidence.
